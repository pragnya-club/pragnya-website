## About Me
Hello!!!  
Trivarna here, a CSE sophomore at GITAM and a member of the Gitam ACM club.  
I'm thrilled to be a member of the Pragnya club.  
Meeting new people and getting to know them never ceases to excite me.  
I enjoy solving problems using coding.  
My long-term objective is to work for a well-paying corporation and expand my skill set.
