## About Me
Hello everyone. This is Teja Subhash Lanka; I'm a 19-year-old guy from Hyderabad. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in computer science engineering from GITAM University, Vizag. I like to think of myself as an ambitious and very free-spirited person. I'm fond of a lot of things, very curious and always looking to explore something new. One of my biggest hobbies is watching movies and exploring the latest things technology has to offer. That interest and passion are what drove me to pursue Computer Science. Apart from all that I love talking to people and interacting with them but enjoy my solitude; SoI like to think of myself as an ambivert.
