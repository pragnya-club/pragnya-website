# About me 
Good morning, firstly, I thank you for giving me the golden opportunity to introduce myself.\n


My name is Y.kumar Swamy born and bought up in Kakinada.

I've pursued my bachelor's degree in computer applications from GITAM College Vishakhapatanam.

In my firstl year, I started studying computer science through my College, in a result of not getting placed for the first 3 to 4 companies I started improving my skills and I got my certificate from
Google in the Digital Marketing domain and Cloud computing.

Rather than doing courses related to my degree, I found my interests and passion in the courses I've been certified with all my dedication and passion I will give my cent per cent commitment and would work smart towards the utilisation

Thank you once again
