# Bharadwaj
My name is Chellapilla S V Bharadwaj.  
I am currently studying Cse and I am in my 2nd year.  
So my hobbies are playing cricket and badminton.  
I want to become a SDE at top MNC company.So at present trying to learn new skills.  
Trying to upgrade my self. I also want to improve my communication as well as soft skills. Other than that trying to prepare for gate cse.  
The thing that makes me crazy about Cse is that whenever you try to make or build something on your own and it becomes successful and when you get desired output you feel happy and excited that you could do something on your own.
